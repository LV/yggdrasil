In Norse mythology, the cosmos revolve and are held together by the branches and roots of the mighty tree [[https://norse-mythology.org/cosmology/yggdrasil-and-the-well-of-urd/][Yggdrasil]].

In this repository, /Yggdrasil/ is the network of which the entire infrastructure for my home network will come to rely on.

** Kvasir - The Wise Raspberry Pi 5
Kvasir amongst the wisest of all beings in the Norse mythology, and was birthed from the fermentation of berries that were spat into a vat together by the Vasir and Aethir gods as a form of a peace treaty. Kvasir was eventually killed by two dwarfs.

In this repository, /Kvasir/ is the name of the Raspberry Pi 5 8GB machine that will serve as the first node of this infrastructure. It will host the following:

- The webpage for my project [[http://odysseia.io/][odysseia.io]]
- A Git Server via [[https://forgejo.org/][Forgejo]]
- Perhaps an email server
- Perhaps a Minecraft server
