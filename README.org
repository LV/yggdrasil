In Norse mythology, the cosmos revolve and are held together by the branches and roots of the mighty tree [[https://norse-mythology.org/cosmology/yggdrasil-and-the-well-of-urd/][Yggdrasil]].

In this repository, /Yggdrasil/ is the network of which the entire infrastructure for my home network will come to rely on.

* Machines
** Kvasir - The Wise Raspberry Pi 5
Kvasir amongst the wisest of all beings in the Norse mythology, and was birthed from the fermentation of berries that were spat into a vat together by the Vasir and Aethir gods as a form of a peace treaty. Kvasir was eventually killed by two dwarfs.

In this repository, /Kvasir/ is the name of the Raspberry Pi 5 8GB machine that will serve as the first node of this infrastructure. It will host the following:

- The webpage for my project [[http://odysseia.io/][odysseia.io]]
- A Git Server via [[https://forgejo.org/][Forgejo]]
- Perhaps an email server
- Perhaps a Minecraft server

*** Setting Up the Machine
**** Installing the OS
The following assumes a completely fresh install of Raspbian 64-bit Minimal running Debian 12.7 Bookworm. See the  [[https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-the-operating-system][official Raspberry Pi docs]] on installing the OS.

**** Installing Docker
Once the machine is up and running, set up Docker's ~apt~ repository to install the latest version (as per the [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-repository][official docs]]):
#+begin_src sh
  # Add Docker's official GPG key:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
  sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
  sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
  sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

  # Add the repository to Apt sources:
  echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
    $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
  sudo apt-get update
#+end_src

And install the latest version of Docker:
#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
#+end_src

Finally, test that Docker works:
#+begin_src sh
  sudo docker run hello-world
#+end_src

**** Installing Docker Compose
This assumes you setup Docker's ~apt~ repository from the step before.

As per the [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository][official docs]]:
#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
#+end_src

and test its installation by checking the version:
#+begin_src sh
  docker compose version
#+end_src

* Modules
** Seshat (Forgejo)
Seshat, daugher of Thoth, is an ancient Egyptian goddess for writing, wisdom, and knowledge. She's known for being a scribe and for her record keeping.

In this repository, /Seshat/ is the Git instance used to store all code part of the Odysseia Project. It uses [[https://forgejo.org/][Forgejo]] as the system for this Git instance.

Forgejo is the open-source program used to host Git instances (link to [[https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/installation-docker/][docs]])
